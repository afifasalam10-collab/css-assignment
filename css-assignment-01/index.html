            CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to describe how HTML elements should be displayed on a web page. It is mainly used to make web pages look attractive and well-structured. CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, background images, spacing, and overall design of a website. With the help of CSS, web developers can separate the content of a webpage (written in HTML) from its presentation or design. This separation makes it easier to maintain and update websites without changing their structure. CSS also helps make websites responsive, meaning they can adjust their layout according to different screen sizes such as mobiles, tablets, and computers. By using CSS, we can create modern, professional, and visually appealing web pages that enhance user experience and readability.
